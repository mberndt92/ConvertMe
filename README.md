# ConvertMe
A personal project as part of 100 Days of SwiftUI - A unit conversion app

## V1 - Temperature conversion only
The requirement for v1 was to choose **one** of several unit conversions.
- Temperature (Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit)
- Length (kilometers, feet, yard, miles)
- Time (seconds, minutes, hours, day)
- Volume (milliliters, liters, cups, pints, gallons)

I planned on adding all of them but decided to do 1 of them first -> So V1 only supports **temperature** conversion
Since I couldn't decide on a quick but slick UI I skipped the rest for now.
I'll likely come back later (famous last words) once I learned/re-learned a bit better on how to navigate best with SwiftUI to organize the UI better.
